# Text Classification with Machine Learning and OpenAI

:- This project aims to demonstrate text classification using machine learning techniques and OpenAI technologies. Text classification is a common task in natural language processing (NLP) where the goal is to categorize text documents into predefined categories. In this project, we leverage machine learning algorithms along with OpenAI's language model to perform text classification on a given dataset.
